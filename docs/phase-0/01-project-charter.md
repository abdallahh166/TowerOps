# Phase 0 — Project Charter (Year 1)

## 1) Problem Statement
Field maintenance operations currently depend on Excel-based workflows that create repetitive manual entry, weak traceability, ambiguous approvals, and no real-time SLA visibility.

## 2) Business Objective (Year 1)
Digitally transform field maintenance operations by replacing Excel-based documentation with a centralized structured system for:
- Corrective Maintenance (CM)
- Preventive / Baseline Maintenance (PM / BM)

## 3) Measurable Targets (Year 1)
- SLA Compliance: **≥ 95%**
- MTTR: **≤ 8 hours**
- First Time Fix: **≥ 90%**
- Reopen Rate: **≤ 5%**
- Evidence Completeness: **≥ 98%**

## 4) In-Scope (Phase 1)
- Work Order lifecycle management
- Visit execution tracking
- Issue tracking
- SLA Engine (response/resolution/breach)
- Multi-layer approval workflow
- Evidence upload and validation
- Basic unified dashboard with filters

## 5) Out-of-Scope (Deferred)
- Mobile offline mode
- Advanced BI
- Predictive maintenance
- Asset depreciation tracking
- ERP integration

## 6) Governance Model
Dual governance with separated CM and BM lines:
- CM: Area Manager → Office Manager → CM Supervisor → Shift/Hardware Engineers
- BM: Head of Maintenance → BM Manager → BM Monitoring Engineer → BM Field Engineers

## 7) Success Definition
The project is considered successful when:
1. Engineers stop using Excel for operational execution.
2. All Work Orders are traceable end-to-end.
3. SLA is measurable in real time.
4. Approvals are structured and role-driven.
5. KPI ownership is explicit and enforced.
